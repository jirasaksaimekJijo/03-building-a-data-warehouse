# Week 3: ETL Pipeline for a Cloud Data Warehouse (Google BigQuery)

## Description
Google BigQuery is a fully managed, serverless, and highly scalable cloud data warehouse provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It allows you to analyze big data using SQL queries without the need for managing infrastructure. With BigQuery, you can store and query massive datasets quickly and efficiently, making it suitable for analytics, business intelligence, machine learning, and other data-driven tasks.

To load JSON data into Google BigQuery, prepare your data, create a dataset, define the schema, load the data using the web UI, bq tool, or API, then verify and query it.
